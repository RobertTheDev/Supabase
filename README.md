Give me some supabase challenges from beginner to advanced

# Supabase Challenges

This document outlines a series of challenges to help you master Supabase, an open-source alternative to Firebase. The challenges are categorized into three levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced.

## Beginner Challenges

1. **Set Up a Supabase Project**

   - Create a new project on Supabase.
   - Connect the project to a new or existing PostgreSQL database.
   - Explore the Supabase dashboard and familiarize yourself with its features.

2. **User Authentication**

   - Implement email/password authentication in a simple web application.
   - Enable third-party OAuth providers like Google or GitHub.
   - Set up and customize email templates for user sign-up and password recovery.

3. **Basic CRUD Operations**

   - Create a table (e.g., "Tasks") in the Supabase database.
   - Build a simple web app to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on this table.
   - Use Supabase’s JavaScript client library for database interactions.

4. **Real-time Subscriptions**
   - Set up real-time subscriptions to listen for changes in a table.
   - Update the web app to display changes in real-time without refreshing the page.
   - Test the real-time updates by making changes directly in the Supabase dashboard and observing the app.

## Intermediate Challenges

5. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

   - Define different roles (e.g., Admin, User) and set up RBAC policies in Supabase.
   - Implement these roles in a web app and restrict access to certain features based on the user's role.
   - Test the access control rules to ensure they work as expected.

6. **Using Supabase Storage**

   - Set up Supabase Storage and create a bucket.
   - Implement file upload and download functionalities in a web app.
   - Manage file permissions and access controls.

7. **Serverless Functions**

   - Write a serverless function using Supabase's Edge Functions.
   - Deploy the function and call it from your web app.
   - Handle different types of inputs and outputs in the function.

8. **Full-text Search**
   - Enable full-text search on a table in Supabase.
   - Build a search interface in your web app to query the database using full-text search.
   - Optimize the search queries for better performance.

## Advanced Challenges

9. **Complex Database Relationships**

   - Design and implement complex relationships between multiple tables (e.g., many-to-many, one-to-many).
   - Use foreign keys and joins to query related data.
   - Build a web app that displays and manipulates related data efficiently.

10. **Advanced Security Rules**

    - Write custom security policies using PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) to protect sensitive data.
    - Test the security rules to ensure they prevent unauthorized access.
    - Audit and monitor security rules for potential vulnerabilities.

11. **Integrating with External APIs**

    - Use Supabase functions to interact with external APIs.
    - Combine data from external APIs with data from your Supabase database.
    - Build a feature in your web app that utilizes this integrated data.

12. **Performance Optimization**

    - Analyze the performance of your Supabase database.
    - Implement indexing, caching, and query optimization techniques.
    - Monitor and optimize the performance of your web app using Supabase's built-in tools and external services.

13. **Building a Real-Time Collaborative Application**

    - Create a collaborative document editor where multiple users can edit documents in real-time.
    - Use Supabase’s real-time capabilities to synchronize changes across users.
    - Handle conflict resolution and data consistency.

14. **Deploying a Production-Ready Application**
    - Deploy your Supabase-powered application to a production environment.
    - Implement logging, monitoring, and error tracking.
    - Set up automated backups and disaster recovery strategies.

By progressing through these challenges, you will gain a deep understanding of Supabase and how to use its features effectively to build robust applications.
